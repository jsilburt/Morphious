# Morphious
MORPHIOUS utilizes a one class support vector machine to segment regions of activated microglia and astrocyte cells using input from untreated images.
For more details on what MORPHIOUS can do, you can read the [publication](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-021-02376-9)

# Tutorials
To use MORPHIOUS simply download this repository as a .zip file (listed under the "code" dropdown menu)
[A written tutorial is available in v2/tutorial_writeup/](https://github.com/jsilburt/Morphious/tree/master/v2/tutorial_writeup)
